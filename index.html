<h3>Spruce Meadows, Alberta</h3>
<p>Spruce Meadows is an international jumping facility located in Calgary, Alberta. Riders from all over the world travel to compete
    in the competitions that are hosted here. I have had the honour of traveling to Spruce Meadows multiple times to compete on my own horse.
</p>

<p>In addition to hosting international show jumping competitions, Spruce Meadows also hosts the a christmas market and lights display
    every year. They also are home to the Calary Premier League's Calvary FC soccer club. There are seven outdoor arenas and two indoor,
    as well as enough stable capacity to host 1,000 horses. 
</p>

<p> Being a showjumper myself, I have had to opportunity to compete at Spruce Meadows multiple times throughout my career. While I have never
    made it to the international level, the venue is still able to make the less experienced classes fun, which brings more and more people
    to compete there every year.
